For commercial use please pay $25 (USD) via PayPal to me at:

Please add a note to your payment stating your name / company name / font name.

Alternatively, if you require an invoice, please email me with your details (name / company / address)
and I will send you an invoice to pay via PayPal or card.

My preferred method of payment is via PayPal (because it ensures I get the full amount)
*but*

If you are interested in licensing a lot of my fonts, email me the font list and I will give you a heavily discounted bundle deal offer.

If you are interested in licensing all 600+ of my fonts, email me the specifics, and I will give you a "Full Set" Bundle Deal.
This Full Set Bundle cost will cost between $200 - $1000 - depending on your company size / font use -  and cover every font I have created to date.

Thank you for downloading this font and I hope you find a use for it!
